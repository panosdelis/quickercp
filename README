Project4 Operating Systems at National and Kapodistrian University of Athens on Department of Informatics and Telecommunications 

The project consists of 9 files:

-4 Source files: quic.c basicFunctions.c recursiveCopyDelete.c outputFunctions.c
-3 Header files: basicFunctions.h recursiveCopyDelete.h outputFunctions.h
-1 Makefile
-1 README: This file.

This is a simple program coping the components of one dir to another in any disk. The improvement from a simple copy is the check for pre existing files and does not copy those with result saving time.

For the compilation we use "make" and we have the executable quic:

The basic arguments we give are the <source dir> , the <dest dir> and we have some options with flags. ex: ./quic <source dir> <dest dir>
If the <dest dir> does not exist it will be created.

Can be executed as:
Without flags:
./quic /home/panos/Downloads beta

With some flags:
./quic -d /home/panos/Downloads beta

With all the flags:
./quic -v -d -l beta/media/panos/USBstick

The flags must always be after the quic and before the folders, ie in the 1-2-3 positions of variables, and their order does not matter.

The program can always manage soft link folders and hardlink files, ie if we give a directory that has soft hard links without the -l flag, the normal files in the destination directory will be copied.

The flag -l works as: Since the two folders are on the same disk and there is also the flag, all the folders and files will be copied with links.

The flag -d deletes what exists in the destfolder that does not exist in the origin.

The flag -v simply allows messages to be printed during the copy and see what we copy in realtime.


The work has been made and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and the school linux.

Below we have controls and their results compared to cp using time.
